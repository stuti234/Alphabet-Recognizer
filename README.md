# Alphabet-Recognizer

This code helps you classify different alphabets using softmax regression (lower case).

## Code Requirements ü¶Ñ
You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.

## Description ‚öôÔ∏è
Softmax Regression (synonyms: Multinomial Logistic, Maximum Entropy Classifier, or just Multi-class Logistic Regression) is a generalization of logistic regression that we can use for multi-class classification (under the assumption that the classes are mutually exclusive). In contrast, we use the (standard) Logistic Regression model in binary classification tasks.

## Python  Implementation üë®‚Äçüî¨

1) Dataset- Extended MNIST dataset (letters)
2) Images of size 28 X 28
3) Classify alphabets from a to z
4) Logistic Regression, Shallow Network and Deep Network Support added.



## Execution üêâ

To run the code, type `python Alpha-Rec.py`

```
python Alpha-Rec.py
